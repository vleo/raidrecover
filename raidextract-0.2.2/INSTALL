To compile, unpack the distribution and run 'make'.
This will create the following programs:

  raidextract - extract the data stream from the disks
  parityinfo -  give information about which disks raidextract would use
  xor - xor blocks of data

In addition, static versions of the programs are created in case you are
reduced to using recovery floppies.

These programs are for Linux 2.4 and will not work on older kernel versions.
