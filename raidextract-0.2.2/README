This distribution contains utilities that might assist you when
recovering data from a crashed RAID5 array.

                  USE THESE TOOLS AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Operating on the disks from a RAID array is not a risk-free operation,
but the risk can be mitigated by taking copies of the raw disks before
attempting any recovery.

Building instructions are in the INSTALL file.
Copying permission is in COPYING.
